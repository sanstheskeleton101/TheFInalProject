    <h1>Appearence</h1>
    <p3>Sans appears as a relatively short and paunchy skeleton. Sans is always seen with a wide, toothy-grin on his face. Sans wears a blue hoodie, a white t-shirt underneath, black shorts with white stripes, and a pair of slippers. He has white dots in black eye sockets that disappear when he is serious or angered. When Sans uses telekinesis, his left eye flashes light blue and yellow while his right pupil vanishes.</p3>
    <h1>Personality</h1>
    <p3>Sans is often depicted as a  lazy and laid back person, He is always sleeping on the job and is almost never at his sentry station. His laziness is a combination of fatalism and apathy, as he is aware of  the timeline being reset. Conversely, he suggests that this knowledge could be "a poor excuse for being lazy." He enjoys being mischievous and primarily acts this way towards those he is on good terms with. His antics range from a variety of illogical, juvenile, and slightly inconvenient pranks. A few examples of this is when Sans tried to sell â€œfried snow," use of whoopee cushions as when the protagonist shook sans hand and when sans painted on the telescope. He is not above utilising his teleportation or other magic for practical jokes either. Sans is also fond of making the occasional low-brow puns. He enjoys making others laugh in general, as he also performs at the MTT resort as a comedian.Despite Sans being apathetic towards his own life, he is considerate to those he cares for. For example, Sans is a regular at Grillby's even though he never pays his tab and the monsters and Royal Guard dogs treat him kindly. Sans has informed Big mouth about "all kinds of incredible foods," yet Big Mouth comments that "he always orders the worst burger off the menu." Eventhough Sans hates making promises, he respects  Toriel's request to watch out for any humans due to them being good friends. Even if the protagonist killed people that were close to him, Sans refrains from bringing up the topic until the Last Corridor. In a Neutral Route ending where Papyrus or Toriel is alive, Sans omits the protagonist's slaughter to either of them.</p3>

    <p3> He is also observant; Reading the protagonist's expressions and can often tell when they have already done certain tasks, as when SAVING and reloading. Though Sans is usually agreeable, he can become eerily serious to emphasize a subject. Regardless of the protagonist being partially or wholly merciful, Sans tells them that if "the old lady" (confirmed in the True Pacifist Route to be Toriel) had not asked him to promise to protect them. They would be dead where they stand. During the Genocide Route, he does everything in his power to kill the protagonist, even faking mercy.</p3>

    <br> 
    <p3>Sans may have a scientific background. Evidence includes the quantum physics book, his workshop, affinity for science,his inexplicable ability to teleport and his timeline research. Sans has implied he once longed and searched for a life that he cannot go back to as he "gave up trying to go back a long time ago". As a Lost Soul, he tells the protagonist that "you'll never see 'em again." Although what Sans is trying to return to is vague.</p3>
