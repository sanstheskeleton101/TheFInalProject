    <h1>Neutral Route</h1>
    <p3>Sans introduces himself to the protagonist in Snowdin Forest appearing as a silhouette but then after shaking his hand he is revealed and the protagonist is pranked from the whoopee cushion on his hand. He explains that he has no interest in capturing humans but that his brother Papyrus is a human catching fanatic. Then Sans hides the protagonist behind a conveniently shaped lamp shaped like the protagonist. Papyrus rushes on screen, and the brothers discuss Sans's laziness and the importance of puzzle upkeep. Sans appears multiple times throughout Snowdin Forest, observing and commentating on the puzzles but not doing any practical jokes, except for in the word search. Before Papyrus's battle, Sans is absent in Snowdin Town. He appears briefly to play trombone during the date/hangout with Papyrus but does not appear again until the Last corridor, if the protagonist decides to kill Papyrus.


        After entering Waterfall, Sans is found at a sentry station and asks the protagonist if they want to take a break with him. If the protagonist agrees, he takes them to Grillby’s via a "shortcut”. The customer's warmly greet Sans, and he proceeds to treat the protagonist to a burger or fries. After some dialogue, a spotlight falls on him and the protagonist and time appears to stop as Sans tells the protagonist that a flower has been talking to Papyrus. Sans believes that someone is tricking Papyrus with an  Echo flower when the flower in question is actually Flowey. Sans can be seen again in Waterfall and pranks the protagonist with a red-eye telescope. Later, if Papyrus was killed, "a hooded figure" watches the battle with Shyren. However, if Papyrus was spared, Sans sells concert tickets made of toilet paper.This implies that Sans is the hooded figure before Sans tells the protagonist the limit of head dogs.
        
        The protagonist passes him sleeping at a sentry post in Hotland if the protagonist flees from Undyne. Undyne notices him sleeping and scolds him mid-chase. Sans does not appear in this spot if Undyne was killed, even if Papyrus was spared. Later, Sans sells Hot dogs in Hotland for 30G. If the protagonist attempts to buy a Hot Dog when their inventory is full, he stacks a maximum of 30 Hot Dogs on their head for free.Further on, Sans waits outside of the MTT Resort and asks the protagonist if they want to grab a bite to eat. He escorts the protagonist inside via "shortcut" and talks about a woman he has befriended, a woman on the other side of the ruin door  that shares his affinity for puns. He tells the protagonist that this woman (Toriel) made him promise to protect any human that left the Ruins and that, if she had not said anything, the protagonist would be "dead where [they] stand." He dismisses this as a joke immediately and says that he has done a great job protecting the protagonist. If the protagonist has not died before, Sans takes credit for their success. If the protagonist has died, Sans questions the validity of his statement. Before leaving, he tells the protagonist to take care of themself because someone really cares about them.
        </p3>
    <h1>True Pacifist Route</h1>
    <p3>Sans is absent from the Last Corridor in the True Pacifist Route. However, he does appear during the pre-Asriel cutscene and meets Toriel face-to-face for the first time. Flowey binds Sans and the protagonist's other friends, then eventually absorbs their SOULs after they defend the protagonist from Flowey.
        During the battle against Asriel, Sans appears as one of the Lost souls alongside Papyrus.
         
        After defeating Asriel, Sans stands alongside the other main characters. If the protagonist talks to him, he says a certain remark depending on what, if anything, the protagonist said to Toriel in calls at the beginning of the game. Sans also uses Toriel’s phone to text her a few times because Toriel's thumbs are too big for the phone buttons. When the protagonist is ready to leave, Sans exits the Underground and heads to the Surface along with the other monsters and watches the sunset. When Papyrus runs off to introduce himself to the humans, Sans says that someone must keep him away from trouble and runs off in the opposite direction, presumably to use a "shortcut”. In the credits. Sans rides a tricycle on a highway and overtakes Papyrus's sports car, much to his brother's annoyance.

    <h1>Genocide Route</h1>
    <p3>Sans stalks and introduces himself to the protagonist as usual but requests that they continue pretending to be a human. He does not comment on the protagonist turning around before he asks them to. Sans goes along with Papyrus's japery and does not appear as an NPC as he does on other routes. After the protagonist crosses the bridge before Snowdin Town, Sans warns them not to fight his brother or else they will "have a bad time." He then disappears and is absent until the Last Corridor.
        If the protagonist aborts the Genocide Route by sparing Papyrus, Sans reappears at the Waterfall sentry station and expresses his respect for their mercy to Papyrus.[30] He continues to appear as he does on the Neutral Route but does not take the protagonist to Grillby's since Snowdin has been evacuated.
        After killing Papyrus, the protagonist continues to kill all the monsters in the Underground. Sans watches them secretly without confronting them directly, hoping they would heed his friendly advice and stop. Eventually, he decides to stop them himself no matter what.
        Sans confronts the protagonist in the Last Corridor but does not judge, instead claiming they must have been busy. He starts off by paraphrasing one of Papyrus' statements. Instead of answering, the protagonist takes a step forward.
        Next Sans laughs and asks "do you wanna have a bad time?", threatening them with force should they proceed. When the protagonist dismisses his warnings and continues to advance, he fights them.
        Before the battle begins, Sans apologizes to the late Toriel for breaking his promise to her.
        Sans repeatedly dodges the protagonist's attempts to hit him and retaliates with his relentless attacks, doing his best to stop them. When he approaches exhaustion, he decides to stall forever by doing nothing, and refuses to let the protagonist have their turn, hoping they will eventually quit of boredom. Sans however falls asleep, giving the protagonist a window of opportunity without his interference. When they manage to attack again, Sans dodges once more, but fails to avoid the second, and takes a whopping 9999999 damage.
        Recognizing his failure, Sans makes one desperate attempt to deter the protagonist, and slowly walks out of the screen while joking that he is going to Grillby's. He then speaks to his dead brother, asking him if he wants anything, and disintegrates shortly after.
        After defeating Sans, the protagonist's EXP is set to 99999, and their LV reaches 20. Sans will make certain remarks if he notices the protagonist has defeated him before and is fighting him again by resetting or through loading a SAVE.
        Sans does not count as a kill in the Stats menu.
